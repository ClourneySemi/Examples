Description: Example about how to read out measurement data for capacitance measurements with internal BIAS

General Information:
Please always check this example script for unsuitable setting that may
destroy your DUT before connecting it to the instrument!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information has been
compiled with care. However, errors can not be ruled out.
